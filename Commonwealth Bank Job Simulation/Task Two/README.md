Provide a list of actions to contain, resolve, and recover from the incident.
Describe post-incident activities and measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Background Information
Here is the background information on your task
As a member of the cyber security division, your team must handle this incident and the team lead has assigned the issue to you. Below is the timeline of events:

- *10:30 a.m.* – The IT Service Desk receives a report from one of your colleagues at the bank that they have received an email from HR telling all employees to update their timesheets in the company’s support portal so the timesheets can be approved on time by their line managers against the next pay day. The colleague clicked the link in the email that opened what looked like the portal. However, following the employee's input of the user credentials, an unfamiliar error page appeared like the one below.


- *2:00 p.m.* – Eight more reports of emails similar to the one reported earlier are received by the IT Service Desk. Upon further investigation, it was found that 62 colleagues across the Risk Department received the same email over the course of two days.  The emails directed the users to a fake website to steal their usernames and passwords and download a harmful program.
- *3:50 p.m.* – The IT Service Desk receives calls and emails from more colleagues that the file-shares are not opening and they receive an error when trying to open a Word document they have always been able to open.

## Task: Answer
Phishing Attack: The initial email sent to employees from HR requesting them to update their timesheets seems suspicious. The fact that it directed users to a fake website to steal their usernames and passwords indicates a phishing attempt. Additionally, the subsequent reports of colleagues receiving similar emails and encountering issues with file-shares and Word documents suggest a broader attack aimed at compromising user credentials and delivering harmful payloads.
As a cyber security analyst, the next steps to take include:

Immediate Response:

Notify affected users: Inform all users who received the phishing email about the incident and advise them to change their passwords immediately.
Disable compromised accounts: Disable any accounts that have been compromised to prevent further unauthorized access.
Investigate further: Conduct a detailed analysis of the phishing email and the fake website to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) and potential malware.
Containment, Resolution, and Recovery:

Contain the threat: Isolate affected systems and networks to prevent the spread of malware and further compromise.
Remove malicious files: Scan and remove any malicious files or programs that may have been downloaded onto the affected systems.
Restore from backups: Restore any affected files or systems from clean backups to ensure business continuity.
Patch vulnerabilities: Identify and patch any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited by the attackers to prevent future similar incidents.
Post-Incident Activities:

Conduct a post-incident review: Analyze the incident response process to identify any gaps or areas for improvement.
Update security policies: Review and update security policies and procedures to mitigate similar attacks in the future.
Provide user education: Conduct training sessions to educate employees about phishing attacks and how to recognize and report them.
Monitor for further activity: Implement monitoring and detection mechanisms to detect any further suspicious activity or attempted intrusions.
By following these steps, the organization can effectively contain, resolve, and recover from the phishing attack while also implementing measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Task 2 Example Answer: 

What kind of attack has happened, and why do you think so? 
In a phishing attack, the perpetrator pretends to be a reputable entity or person via email to obtain sensitive information like login credentials. In this case, the attacker disguised as the company's HR by asking employees to update their timesheets. 
Malware is intrusive software designed to harm or exploit computers. In this case, the user executed a phishing attack payload that may have installed malware onto their system. As users cannot open a Word document that they have always been able to open, this could be ransomware or a virus. 
As a cyber security analyst, what are the next steps to take? List all that apply. 
Begin documenting the investigation. 
Prioritise handling the incident based on factors such as functional impact, information impact and recoverability effort. 
Advise users to change and strengthen all logins, passwords and security questions. 
How would you contain, resolve and recover from this incident? List all answers that apply. 
Identify and mitigate all exploited vulnerabilities. 
Attempt to remove malware from all hosts affected. 
Return affected systems to an operationally ready state. 
Confirm that the affected systems are functioning normally. 
Stay alert and continue to monitor for any similar future activity. 
What activities should be performed post-incident? 
Follow-up report detailing everything that occurred. 
Hold a lesson-learnt meeting. 
Educate: Create a cyber awareness program for employees. Such programs help employees identify future phishing emails.
