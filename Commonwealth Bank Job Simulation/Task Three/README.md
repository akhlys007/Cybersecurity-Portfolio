## Background Information
Security awareness is the knowledge and understanding of potential security threats and best practices for protecting yourself and your organisation against those threats. It's about being aware of the different types of cyber threats, such as phishing scams and malware, and understanding how to avoid them. It also means staying up to date with the latest security trends and information, so you can make informed decisions and take actions to keep yourself and your organisation safe.

Security awareness also includes knowing how to create strong and secure passwords, as well as understanding the best practices for keeping software and systems updated. Additionally, it involves understanding the legal and regulatory requirements related to information security. Overall, security awareness is important because it helps individuals and organisations stay vigilant against potential threats and take proactive steps to protect themselves and their assets.

One way to raise security awareness is by creating an infographic. An infographic can serve as a reminder to employees about the importance of secure passwords and other best practices for information security. It can also help to reinforce the organisation's commitment to security and raise awareness about the specific steps that should be taken to protect sensitive information.

Moreover, an infographic can be used as a tool for education, particularly in the aftermath of a security incident like the one in the previous task. It can help employees understand how to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, serving as an effective tool for incident response management and employee engagement in security awareness. This is what you are going to be doing in this task, creating an infographic to raise security awareness on password security among your peers based on Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) advice.

## Task
To design an effective infographic to raise security awareness on password security among fellow employees, follow these steps:

1. Research the best practices for creating secure passwords according to the ACSC website.
2. Choose software or online tool to design the infographic (e.g Canva).
